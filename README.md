:warning: This is under active development :construction:

A Common Lisp implementation of the
[Apache Avro](https://github.com/apache/avro) data serialization system.

This was written against the
[Avro 1.10.1 spec](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.1/spec.html)
and there are a few TODOS:

* [Avro RPC](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.1/spec.html#Protocol+Declaration)
is not implemented.
* [JSON Encoding](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.1/spec.html#json_encoding)
is not implemented.
