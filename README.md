:warning: This is under active development :construction:

A Common Lisp implementation of the
[Apache Avro](https://github.com/apache/avro) data serialization system.

The API is still baking :bread:, but this is by and large a complete
implementation: recursive schemas, serialization, ipc/rpc,
fingerprinting, schema resolution, object container files, and single
object encodings are all supported.
